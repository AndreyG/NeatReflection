## Future tasks
 - [ ] Add examples
 - [ ] Expose the Reflection library as a module instead of #include
 - [ ] IFC-reader library pulls in Boost just for memory mapping the file. This dependency should be removed
 - [ ] Add support for GCC (via .cmi) 
 - [ ] Clang (via clang's BMI solution)
 - [ ] User Attributes are not exposed in .ifc 
 - [ ] Support more build systems
